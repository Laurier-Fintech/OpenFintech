# **ðŸ“¦ OpenFintech: Opensource Fintech Library**

### **1. Introduction**

OpenFintech is a pioneering project designed with the primary objective of allowing users to create custom high-frequency trading algorithms and introducting them to financial technology as a field ðŸ’». This project also includes wrappers for SQLite3, MySQL, MongoDB (in-development), and Alphavantage (a financial information API)*.*

#### **1.1. Who Is OpenFintech For?**

OpenFintech is tailored for:

- **Students** who have a keen interest in:
  - Delving deeper into trading algorithms.
  - Grasping the basics of algorithmic trading and fintech.
  - Undertaking both backtesting and simulated live testing of their algorithmic trading strategy.

### **2. The Heart of OpenFintech: Mean Reversion Strategy**

#### **2.1. Conceptualizing Mean Reversion**

Mean reversion is the cornerstone of the strategies offered by OpenFintech. It is premised on the theory that asset prices, volatility, and historical returns will eventually revert to the long-run mean of the entire dataset. In the financial realm, this mean can manifest in various contexts, such as a stock's historical price data, P/E ratio or the average return of an industry sector.

#### **2.2. Potential Risks**

It's crucial to note that a return to the norm isn't always guaranteed. Unexpected market highs or lows could signal a shift in the usual trend. Events that might trigger such shifts include product launches or, on the flip side, recalls and lawsuits.

### **3. The Brain Behind the Operations: Model.py and Backtesting**

At the core of OpenFintech's algorithmic strategies is the `Model.py` file, which focuses on backtesting the strategies to provide users with realistic and insightful simulations.

#### **3.1. Algorithmic Trading Strategies our system offers (for now at least ðŸ‘€)**

1. Moving Average (SMA) with Different Periods:
   - In this strategy, the system considers two distinct moving averages: one short-term (like the 50-day moving average) and one long-term (like the 200-day moving average).
   - Long Signal: When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, this is a potential sign that the asset is in an upward momentum, thus generating a buy (or "long") signal.
   - Short Signal: Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, the asset might be experiencing a downturn, thus generating a sell (or "short") signal.
   - Customizable parameters:
     - Moving averages (e.x. SMA and EMA) and their associated periods

### **4. How To Use**

Here's a step-by-step guide to using the OpenFintech package:

1. **Installation**:
   Begin by installing the OpenFintech package using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install OpenFintech
   ```
2. **Setting Up The File**:
   After installation, create a Python script and import the required classes from the OpenFintech package.

   ```python
   from OpenFintech import Model
   ```
3. **Variable Configuration**:
   Before proceeding, set up the necessary variables for your database and API configurations. It's recommended to use environment variables to store these values securely.

   ```python
   ALPHAVANTAGE_KEY = "username"
   ```
4. **Initialization**:
   With the above variables, initiate the various handlers:

   - Model handler

   ```python
   handler = Model()
   ```
5. **Setting Backtesting Parameters**:
   Define a dictionary for backtesting settings. This dictionary will contain parameters like starting amount, short and long strategies, stock ticker, and more.

   ```python
   setting_values = {
       "user_id": 1,
       "starting_aum": 100000,
       "short": "EMA 5",
       "long": "SMA 15",
       "ticker": "NIO",
       "stop_loss": 0.10, #%
       "take_profit": 0.5,#%
       "chart_freq_mins": 0
   }
   ```
8. **Backtesting**:
   Call the backtest function from the model handler with the previously defined settings and the alphavantage key

   ```python
   response = handler.backtest(setting_values, ALPHAVANTAGE_KEY)
   print(response)
   ```
10. **Clean Up**:
    After completing all operations, make sure to close the connection to the database.

```python
   handler.disconnect()
   print("Disconnected database connection.")
```

Note: Always ensure that sensitive data such as passwords and API keys are stored securely and are not hard-coded directly into the script.

### **5. Output**

The output of Model.backtest contains the price data as a pandas df and the performance of the settings provided to the algorithm.
