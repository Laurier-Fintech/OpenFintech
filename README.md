### **2. The Heart of OpenFintech: Mean Reversion Strategy**

#### **2.1. Conceptualizing Mean Reversion**

Mean reversion is the cornerstone of the strategies offered by OpenFintech. It is premised on the theory that asset prices, volatility, and historical returns will eventually revert to the long-run mean of the entire dataset. In the financial realm, this mean can manifest in various contexts, such as a stock's historical price data, P/E ratio or the average return of an industry sector.

#### **2.2. Potential Risks**

It's crucial to note that a return to the norm isn't always guaranteed. Unexpected market highs or lows could signal a shift in the usual trend. Events that might trigger such shifts include product launches or, on the flip side, recalls and lawsuits.

### **3. The Brain Behind the Operations: Model.py and Backtesting**

At the core of OpenFintech's algorithmic strategies is the `Model.py` file, which focuses on backtesting the strategies to provide users with realistic and insightful simulations.

#### **3.1. Algorithmic Trading Strategies our system offers (for now at least ðŸ‘€)**

1. Moving Average (SMA) with Different Periods:
    - In this strategy, the system considers two distinct moving averages: one short-term (like the 50-day moving average) and one long-term (like the 200-day moving average).
    - Long Signal: When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, this is a potential sign that the asset is in an upward momentum, thus generating a buy (or "long") signal.
    - Short Signal: Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, the asset might be experiencing a downturn, thus generating a sell (or "short") signal.
    - Customizable parameters:
        - Moving averages (e.x. SMA and EMA) and their associated periods
